# DID Blockchain Architecture

## Overview
The DID (Decentralized Identifier) Blockchain is a specialized blockchain implementation focused on managing decentralized identifiers. This document outlines the system's architecture, components, and their interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Blockchain Core (`blockchain/`)
- **Block Structure**: Implements the fundamental block data structure with DID-specific modifications
- **Transaction Handling**: Manages DID-related transactions (creation, update, revocation)
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Implements Proof of Stake (PoS) for network consensus
- **Validator Management**: Handles validator registration and participation

### 2. Security Layer (`blockchain/security.py`)
- Digital signatures using RSA
- Hash functions (SHA-256)
- Merkle tree implementation
- Key pair generation and management
- Transaction verification

### 3. API Layer (`api/`)
- RESTful API endpoints for:
  - DID management
  - Transaction submission
  - Block queries
  - Validator operations
- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation and rate limiting

### 4. Web Interface (`webapp/`)
- User interface for:
  - DID management
  - Transaction monitoring
  - Network statistics
  - Validator dashboard

## Data Flow

1. **DID Creation/Update**
   ```
   User Request -> API -> Transaction Creation -> Validation -> Block Addition
   ```

2. **Consensus Process**
   ```
   New Block -> Validator Selection -> Block Validation -> Network Agreement -> Chain Addition
   ```

3. **DID Resolution**
   ```
   Resolution Request -> API -> Chain Traversal -> State Compilation -> Response
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Transaction Security**
   - Digital signatures for all transactions
   - Multi-signature support for high-value operations
   - Transaction validation rules

2. **Network Security**
   - Validator stake requirements
   - Slashing conditions for malicious behavior
   - Network communication encryption

3. **Data Protection**
   - Access control for private DID documents
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive
