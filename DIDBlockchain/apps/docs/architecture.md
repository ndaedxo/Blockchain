# Architecture of DIDBlockchain

## Overview

DIDBlockchain is built on a modular architecture that separates concerns into different components. This allows for better maintainability, scalability, and testability of the system.

## Components

1. **Blockchain Layer**: 
   - Responsible for handling all blockchain-related functionalities, including block creation, transaction processing, and consensus mechanisms.
   - Implements proof-of-stake consensus for validating transactions.

2. **API Layer**: 
   - Provides RESTful endpoints for external interaction with the blockchain functionalities.
   - Utilizes Django REST Framework to manage API requests and responses.

3. **User Management**: 
   - Manages user authentication and authorization.
   - Uses a custom user model (`CustomUser`) to handle user data securely, including encrypted private keys.

4. **Utilities**: 
   - Contains various utility functions for logging, configuration, and other helper methods to support the core functionalities.

5. **Frontend Layer**: 
   - Consists of the Django web application, providing a user interface for interacting with the blockchain functionalities.

## Data Flow

1. Users interact with the API layer via HTTP requests.
2. The API layer processes these requests, interacts with the blockchain layer as needed, and returns responses to the users.
3. The blockchain layer handles all operations related to blockchain transactions, ensuring data integrity and security.

## Deployment

DIDBlockchain can be deployed using a WSGI server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI, with a reverse proxy like Nginx for serving static files and managing HTTPS.
